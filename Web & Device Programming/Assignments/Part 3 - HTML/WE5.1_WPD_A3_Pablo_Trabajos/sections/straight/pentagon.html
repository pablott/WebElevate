                <p>A <strong>regular pentagon</strong> has Schläfli symbol {5} and interior angles are 108°.</p>
                <p>A regular pentagon has five lines of reflectional symmetry, and rotational symmetry of order 5 (through 72°, 144°, 216° and 288°). The diagonals of a convex regular pentagon are in the golden ratio to its sides.</p>

            <div id="tabs-2">
                <p>In geometry an <strong>equilateral pentagon</strong> is a polygon with five sides of equal length. Its five internal angles, in turn, can take a range of sets of values, thus permitting it to form a family of pentagons. The requirement is that all angles must add up to 540 degrees and must be between 0 and 360 degrees but not equal to 180 degrees. In contrast, the regular pentagon is unique, because it is equilateral and moreover it is equiangular (its five angles are equal; the measure is 108 degrees).</p>
                <p>Four intersecting equal circles arranged in a closed chain are sufficient to determine a convex equilateral pentagon. Each circle's center is one of four vertices of the pentagon. The remaining vertex is determined by one of the intersection points of the first and the last circle of the chain.</p>
                <p>It is possible to describe any convex equilateral pentagon with only two angles α and β with α ≥ β provided the fourth angle (δ) is the smallest of the rest of the angles. Thus the general equilateral pentagon can be regarded as a bivariate function f(α, β) where the rest of the angles can be obtained by using trigonometric relations. The equilateral pentagon described in this manner will be unique up to a rotation in the plane.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="tabs-3">
                <p>A <strong>cyclic pentagon</strong> is one for which a circle called the circumcircle goes through all five vertices. The regular pentagon is an example of a cyclic pentagon. The area of a cyclic pentagon, whether regular or not, can be expressed as one fourth the square root of one of the roots of a septic equation whose coefficients are functions of the sides of the pentagon.</p>
                <p>There exist cyclic pentagons with rational sides and rational area; these are called Robbins pentagons. In a Robbins pentagon, either all diagonals are rational or all are irrational, and it is conjectured that all the diagonals must be rational.</p>
