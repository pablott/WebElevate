                <p>In Euclidean geometry, a <strong>parallelogram</strong> is a simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. The opposite or facing sides of a parallelogram are of equal length and the opposite angles of a parallelogram are of equal measure. The congruence of opposite sides and opposite angles is a direct consequence of the Euclidean parallel postulate and neither condition can be proven without appealing to the Euclidean parallel postulate or one of its equivalent formulations.</p>
                <p>By comparison, a quadrilateral with just one pair of parallel sides is a trapezoid in American English or a trapezium in British English.</p>
                <p>The three-dimensional counterpart of a parallelogram is a parallelepiped.</p>
                <p>The etymology (in Greek παραλληλ-όγραμμον, a shape "of parallel lines") reflects the definition.</p>

            <div id="tabs-2">
                <p>Traditionally, in two-dimensional geometry, a <strong>rhomboid</strong> is a parallelogram in which adjacent sides are of unequal lengths and angles are non-right angled.</p>
                <p>A parallelogram with sides of equal length (equilateral) is a rhombus but not a rhomboid.
                <p>A parallelogram with right angled corners is a rectangle but not a rhomboid.</p>
                <p>The term rhomboid is now more often used for a parallelepiped, a solid figure with six faces in which each face is a parallelogram and pairs of opposite faces lie in parallel planes. Some crystals are formed in three-dimensional rhomboids. This solid is also sometimes called a rhombic prism. The term occurs frequently in science terminology referring to both its two- and three-dimensional meaning.</p>

            <div id="tabs-3">
                <p>In Euclidean geometry, a <strong>cyclic quadrilateral</strong> or <strong>inscribed quadrilateral</strong> is a quadrilateral whose vertices all lie on a single circle. This circle is called the circumcircle or circumscribed circle, and the vertices are said to be concyclic. The center of the circle and its radius are called the circumcenter and the circumradius respectively. Other names for these quadrilaterals are <strong>concyclic quadrilateral</strong> and <strong>chordal quadrilateral</strong>, the latter since the sides of the quadrilateral are chords of the circumcircle. Usually the quadrilateral is assumed to be convex, but there are also crossed cyclic quadrilaterals. The formulas and properties given below are valid in the convex case.</p>
                <p>The word cyclic is from the Ancient Greek κύκλος (kuklos) which means "circle" or "wheel".</p>
                <p>All triangles have a circumcircle, but not all quadrilaterals do. An example of a quadrilateral that cannot be cyclic is a non-square rhombus. The section characterizations below states what necessary and sufficient conditions a quadrilateral must satisfy to have a circumcircle.</p>
