                <div>
                    <p>In mathematics, a <strong>plane real algebraic curve</strong> is the set of points on the Euclidean plane whose coordinates are zeros of some polynomial in two variables. More generally an <strong>algebraic curve</strong> is similar but may be embedded in a higher dimensional space or defined over some more general field.</p>
                    <p>For example, the unit circle is a real algebraic curve, being the set of zeros of the polynomial x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> – 1.</p>

                <h3>Transcendental curve</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>In mathematics, a <strong>transcendental curve</strong> is a curve that is not an algebraic curve. Here for a curve, C, what matters is the point set (typically in the plane) underlying C, not a given parametrisation. For example, the unit circle is an algebraic curve (pedantically, the real points of such a curve); the usual parametrisation by trigonometric functions may involve those transcendental functions, but certainly the unit circle is defined by a polynomial equation. (The same remark applies to elliptic curves and elliptic functions; and in fact to curves of genus > 1 and automorphic functions.)</p>
                    <p>The properties of algebraic curves, such as Bézout's theorem, give rise to criteria for showing curves actually are transcendental. For example an algebraic curve C either meets a given line L in a finite number of points, or possibly contains all of L. Thus a curve intersecting any line in an infinite number of points, while not containing it, must be transcendental. This applies not just to sinusoidal curves, therefore; but to large classes of curves showing oscillations.</p>
                    <p>The term is originally attributed to Leibniz.</p>

                <h3>Piecewise constructions</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>In mathematics, a <strong>piecewise-defined function</strong> (also called a <strong>piecewise function</strong> or a <strong>hybrid function</strong>) is a function which is defined by multiple sub-functions, each sub-function applying to a certain interval of the main function's domain (a sub-domain). Piecewise is actually a way of expressing the function, rather than a characteristic of the function itself, but with additional qualification, it can describe the nature of the function. For example, a <strong>piecewise polynomial</strong> function is a function that is a polynomial on each of its sub-domains, but possibly a different one on each.</p>
                    <p>The word piecewise is also used to describe any property of a piecewise-defined function that holds for each piece but not necessarily hold for the whole domain of the function. A function is <strong>piecewise differentiable</strong> or <strong>piecewise continuously differentiable</strong> if each piece is differentiable throughout its subdomain, even though the whole function may not be differentiable at the points between the pieces. In convex analysis, the notion of a derivative may be replaced by that of the subderivative for piecewise functions. Although the "pieces" in a piecewise definition need not be intervals, a function is not called "piecewise linear" or "piecewise continuous" or "piecewise differentiable" unless the pieces are intervals.</p>
